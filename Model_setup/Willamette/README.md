# Willamette
Operational model for the Willamette River Basin reservoirs network (adapted from ResSim Lite)
Language: python

To launch a simulation, run the script Launch_Willamette and select a simulation horizon and initial doy. All settings such as input and output file names are controlled by the file settings.xml. Input files should have the same format as the ones in Data/model_streamflows/historic_streamflow_Willamette (cp local flows in cms and resevoirs streamflows in cfs)
