Willamette model initialization data:
The model takes in some initialization values (such as the initial reservoirs volume or cp discharge). We use the cyclostationary mean of the historic records, i.e., one value for each doy.
CP_hist_cyclo_discharge.xls: contains the cyclostationary mean of cp discharge from 1989-2007 USGS records 
RES_hist_cyclo_rel_vol.xls:contains the cyclostationary mean of reservoirs release and volume from 1929-2007 and 2005-2016 historic records respectively (sources: BPA modified streamflows and USACE dataquery)
